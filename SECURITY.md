# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We do **not maintain multiple supported versions**. Only the latest released version is eligible for security updates.

Once a new version is released, the previous version is branched and locked, and will no longer receive updates — including security patches.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.3   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.1.2   | :x:                |
| 0.1.1   | :x:                |
| 0.1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please use the GitHub [Security Advisories](https://github.com/Soumyadeep-ai/console_kit/security/advisories/new) feature to report it privately.

We follow this process:
- All reported vulnerabilities are reviewed promptly.
- A new version with security fixes will be released.
- Once validated, we will publish an advisory and issue a patched release if necessary.

Please avoid disclosing vulnerabilities publicly until we’ve had a chance to review and respond.
